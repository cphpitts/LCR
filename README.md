# LCR

Application to simulate the game LCR. Ability to simulate hundreds of games and see basic statistics based on the games.

##Rules
Players start with 3 chips. On their turn they roll a set of custom dice with 4 outcomes: left, right, center and blank. Depending on the faces rolled, the player will pass a chip to the left, right or to the center pot (removing it from play). The last player with a remaining chip wins.
